Lisp was my first and most enduring love. Other languages delt in
shifting bits and distant abstractions and in prolixity lost
clarity. They always tarnished the thought and distracted the mind
from the ideal. Lisp, where every footfall opens to fractal worlds,
let through the luminous ideal. Not stricken to planar realities nor
poor machine imaginations Lisp plucks symbols from the void and
creates meaning.
